      <h1>Mountain View Terraces - Premier Springbank Hill Condos | Community Site</h1>
      <p>Mountain View Terraces (MVT) is one of Calgary's most desirable condominium complexes. This gem is conveniently located in the vibrant southwest community of Springbank Hill, with excellent highway access due to the recent build of the ring road. The grounds boast beautifully landscaped and immaculately maintained compound as well as beautiful building structures.</p>
      <p>MVT is well-managed and the Board of Directors’ mandate is to enhance the lives of all owners and residents through efficient communication and an effective community presence.</p>
      <p>This website offers the potential for more interaction between the Board and MVT residents. To help further this directive, the Board encourages all owners to become involved and suggests beginning with attendance at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). The AGM is an excellent opportunity to exercise your constructive influence for the coming year.</p>
      <p>In the meantime we have populated this website with information regarding the condominium association, governance of the condominium, and various associated documents and useful information. The idea is to help existing, new, and prospective residents become familiar with the responsibilities and issues of special interest to life at MVT. In addition, this site has the potential to evolve to include various tools and services such as the immediate distribution of time-sensitive information, important announcements, and even community related surveys.</p>
      <p>The Board hopes residents view this site as an enhancement to their MVT home ownership experience and that it increases our sense of community by developing policies and guidelines in directions that are aligned with the views of the majority of residents.</p>
      <p>Help us, help you. What would You like life at Mountain View Terraces to be!</p>
